# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze the data for PyBer, a ridesharing company. By calculating metrics related to the weekly fares for each city type that the company is located in, we were able to come up with conclusions to help further the company. The data analysis included summaries of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride. At the end, the analysis provided recommendation to PyBer CEO to show the differences by each city type.
## Results
The following picture shows the dataframe and the difference by city type.

Some of the conclusions that can be made are:
- Urban cities are the top city type with the most amount of rides with 1625 rides.
- Urban cities generate the most revenue thanks to the most amount of rides, with the revnue of $39,854.
- Urban cities most likely had the most rides thanks to the lowest average fare per driver, at $16.57.
- The number of drivers exceeds the amount of total rides in Ubran city type.

The conclusions that can be made are:
- Urban city type had the highest total fares from the month of January through April.
- The month of March showed the highest trend for fare revenue.
- Suburban city type experienced an increase at the month of April to its end.
## Summary
The recommendation to PyBer CEO are:
- The best performing city type is the Urban city type. Further investments and activities to market PyBer should be implemented in an Ubran city type to increase revenue and volume of rides.
- Rural cities are best to be avoided, where it is inefficient with the average fare price being one of the highest where the total rides and driver number are the lowest among the three city types.
- Suburban city type shows potential in bringing profit to PyBer. It has a good amount of drivers available with good number of rides. The numbers are very consistent without a major peak or downfall during the months. Further investments could lead to a profitable outcome within the suburban location.
